## ğŸ›  Implementation Notes

### Nuxt Stack & Libraries

- **Nuxt 3** was used as the full-stack framework with `pages/`, `layouts/`, and `server/api/` structure.
- **Nuxt UI** provided pre-styled components such as `UButton`, `UCard`, `USwitch`, and `UForm` for a clean and accessible UI.
- **SQLite** was chosen for simplicity and local development convenience.

### Component Design

- **BookListItem.vue** handles display, read toggle, and deletion of each book. The toggle is reactive via `v-model` and emits updates directly inside the toggle logic.
- **BookForm.vue** provides a controlled form to add new books. Uses `reactive()` state and submits via `$fetch`.
- **Layout** is defined in `layouts/default.vue` and includes a simple header and content slot.

### Server Routes

- Server endpoints under `/server/api/books` perform CRUD operations directly on the SQLite database using the sqlite3 Node.js driver.
- A shared `useDB()` utility wraps the SQLite connection logic, making database access clean and reusable.

### Routing

- `/` â€“ displays the current reading list with actions.
- `/add-book` â€“ page to submit a new book entry.

### Known Tradeoffs / Assumptions

- There is no client-side form validation beyond HTML5 `required`; server-side validation is minimal.
- Book titles are not required to be unique.
- The app assumes a single-user context (no auth).
